# BurmaLingo

**Live: https://burmalingo.vercel.app**

English learning web app built specifically for Burmese speakers — by a Burmese immigrant who lived this problem from both sides.

## The Problem

In Myanmar, joining a single level of English class from a well-known teacher costs roughly half a month's basic salary — and that's not a private lesson. That's a seat in a 100-person Zoom class where the teacher doesn't even know or remember your name.

The cheaper options don't solve the problem either. Pre-recorded video courses are affordable but cover only one level — students have to buy multiple separate courses with no coherent progression. YouTube is free but completely unstructured — hours of content with no clear path from where you are to where you need to be.

And even if a Burmese learner finds an English app, it wasn't built for them. The explanations assume you already think in English. The grammar rules are written for someone else. The vocabulary prioritises what matters in the US or UK, not what a Burmese speaker actually needs to know first.

BurmaLingo is the structured, affordable alternative — a 7-level curriculum from beginner to IELTS preparation, built entirely around how Burmese speakers actually learn English, at a price that doesn't require half a month's salary.

## The Founder's Path

Self-study to save money → Zoom classes → both self-study and Zoom classes for IELTS → moved to the US in February 2023 → 3 years living and working in an English environment.

That full journey — knowing what worked at each stage, what was a waste of money, and what no app ever taught — is what this curriculum is built from.
